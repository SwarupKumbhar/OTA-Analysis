# OTA Data Analysis Project
In this project, I analyzed booking data from an Online Travel Agency (OTA) to uncover critical insights related to supplier pricing, refund patterns, and customer loyalty programs. By identifying key trends and patterns, I provided actionable recommendations to improve profitability, reduce refunds, and enhance customer retention through loyalty programs. The analysis was supported by data visualizations and presented in a structured PowerPoint presentation, outlining both short-term and long-term strategies for business improvement.

## Key Contributions:
* Analyzed supplier pricing structures, identifying high-performing suppliers based on price competitiveness and profitability.
* Investigated refund and cashback trends to develop strategies for minimizing refund rates and maximizing customer satisfaction.
* Examined coupon usage and its impact on customer loyalty, providing insights into the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.
* Provided actionable recommendations, including optimizing supplier relationships, reducing refunds, and expanding customer loyalty programs.

## Skills Used:
* Data Analysis: Applied statistical and analytical techniques to identify key patterns and trends in the dataset.
* Data Visualization: Created clear, impactful visualizations to represent insights and support data-driven decision-making.
* Problem-Solving: Developed actionable strategies based on data-driven insights to improve business operations.
* Communication: Delivered insights and recommendations through a PowerPoint presentation, making complex data understandable for stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies:
* Python: For data analysis and creating visualizations (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
* Excel: Initial data exploration and cleaning.
* PowerPoint: For creating a presentation to deliver findings and recommendations.
* Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create insightful visualizations for better understanding of trends and observations.

## Outcome:
**This project successfully provided key insights that could help OTAs optimize their supplier relationships, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability through better pricing strategies, refund management, and loyalty programs.**
